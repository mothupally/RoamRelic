# CORS PROXY ISSUE SOLUTIONS:
# 
# QUICK FIX (2 minutes):
# 1. Go to: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
# 2. Click "Request temporary access to the demo server"
# 3. Refresh your app - real data should load!
#
# The app now tries multiple proxy services automatically:
# - allorigins.win (usually works)
# - corsproxy.io
# - thingproxy.freeboard.io
# - cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com (your current one)
#
# If all proxies fail, you'll see demo data (which is working now)
#
# For production, move API calls to your backend server!
